Create a program to demonstrate the use of Collections methods reverse, fill, copy, max and min

    Get three characters from the user
    Create and display a list of three characters
    Reverse(using Collection method) and display the list
    Create copy list((using Collection method)) from an array of the three Characters
    Copy the contents of list((using Collection method)) in step one into copy list of the step three.
    Fill list((using Collection method) with letter R
    Create a method named output and display at it shown below
    Name your class “Algorithms”

Output:

list contains:

The list is: P C M

Max: P Min: C

 

After calling reverse, list contains:

The list is: M C P

Max: P Min: C

 

After copying, copyList contains:

The list is: M C P

Max: P Min: C

 

After calling fill, list contains:

The list is: R R R

Max: R Min: R
